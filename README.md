Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the art of science  of designing , building and maintaining software solutions  that help solve real world problems using engineering principles.
It basically enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment eductaion and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of programming langauages.
   This milestone emphasized the need for structured development methodologies, formal design processes, and systematic approaches to building software.
    It led to the development of software lifecycle models like the Waterfall Model.
2. Estabblishment of software engineering asa discipline.
   This milestone  was pionered by  Edsger Dijkstra and it helped improve software reliability and efficiency, laying the foundation for modern programming practices.
3. The rise of Agile methodologies.
   This milestone was a response to the limitations of rigid, linear methodologies like Waterfall.
    Agile methodologies emphasizes iterative development, collaboration, customer feedback, and flexibility, allowing teams to adapt to changing requirements.
   
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
   1. Idea generation - defines the project scope, goals, timeline, resources, and risks.
   2.  Requirements analysis - gathers and documents software requirements from stakeholders.
   3.  Product design - architects the system structure and detailed design. 
   4.  product development/ implementation- developers write the actual code based on the design specifications.
   5.  Product integration and testing- identifies and fixes defects through unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing.
   6.  Deployment- releases the software production whether in full or in phases.
   7.  Maintenance -involves fixing bugs, updating features, and ensuring software stability.
   
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
   a. The Waterfall methodology follows a linear and sequential approach, whereas Agile is iterative and incremental. Waterfall is rigid and difficult to change once requirements are set, while Agile is highly flexible and adapts to evolving needs.
   b. Waterfall is best suited for well-defined projects with stable requirements, while Agile is ideal for dynamic projects where requirements may change.
   c. Waterfall delivers the entire product at the end, while Agile delivers functional increments regularly. Testing in Waterfall is performed after development is complete, while Agile incorporates continuous testing throughout.
   d. In Waterfall, the project moves through distinct phases, such as planning, design, coding, testing, and deployment, while Agile follows continuous iterations (sprints or cycles). Waterfall involves minimal customer interaction until the final product is delivered, whereas Agile encourages continuous feedback and collaboration throughout the development process.

For example in Banking Industry, the applications require strict compliance, detailed documentation, and minimal changes once the design is finalized. Waterfall ensures thorough planning and structured execution.
while we can use agile to develop a mobile app with evolving features because it allows developers to continuously update features based on user feedback and market trends.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
   1.Software engineer: writes code and implements software solutions.
   2.Quality Assurance Engineer: ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
   3.Product Mananger: oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
    Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)  are tools for wrting, debugging and testing codes. i.e Vs code, pycharm.
    Version Control sysytems(vcs) are systems that allow collaboration,enabling mutiple people to work on the same project irrespective of their location.ie Git and Github.
 
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
   1. Change of requirements during deployment stage that lead to project delays.
   2. Deadlines. The pressure to develop and deliver a software can lead to compromised quality.
   3. Technical debts that lead to a high maintenance cost.
      
To overcome and mitigate such challenges the following strategies can be employed; effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  1. Unit testing- testing a specific component of the software.
  2. System testing- testing the entire software system.
  3. Acceptance testing -testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
   Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining input prompts to effectively communicate with AI models and obtain the most relevant, accurate, and useful responses. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective. 
   "what are car and which one can i buy for my family?" is a vague prompt.
    while " "List the types and models of cars with their descriptions to help identify a suitable one for my familyâ€™s needs." is a clear, specific and concise prompt.

The improved prompt is more effective because it is more structured and detailed.
